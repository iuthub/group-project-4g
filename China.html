                    <h4 class="content__title">Geography</h4>
                    <p class="content__text">The geography of China is very diverse. Even though China is the most heavily populated country on the planet, it also has some of the most remote and least populated places in the world. This is reinforced by the fact that the vast majority of the population lives on the east coast of the country, making the western provinces sparsely populated. </p>
                    <h4 class="content__title">Events and Festivals</h4>
                    <p class="content__text">China has three "Golden Week" holidays per year. People get a mandatory two or three days off work for each holiday, and workers' companies can grant them the rest of the week off, making each holiday a total of 7 days. As you can imagine, having almost 1.4 billion people with the same days off can make travelling at these times arduous to say the least.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content__text">Travelling during the Spring Festival/Chinese New Year is incredibly difficult. Chinese New Year is China's Christmas, so the millions of migrant workers and students flood back to their home towns. Everybody else takes the opportunity to spend their hong bao (gifts of money traditionally given at CNY) and go travelling. Most of the time, since you are only allowed to purchase train tickets 6 days in advance and must be present in the city of origin, sometimes only standing room tickets are available. Be aware! The Spring Festival is undoubtedly the busiest time for the Chinese transportation system. Flying will avoid the crowded trains, but book early and expect to pay higher prices. All the main tourist attractions will be crawling with tourists (worse than usual), so unless you like crowds, it's best to avoid it altogether.
                        </p>
                        <p class="content__text">Chinese New Year is based on the lunar calendar, so the date changes each year. The Chinese New Year/Spring Festival holiday is 7 days long and usually starts on New Year's Eve.
                        </p>
                        <p class="content__text">The two other national holidays are October 1st, National Day, celebrating the founding of the People's Republic of China and May 1st, which is International Labor Day. Almost all Chinese get the two holidays off and many take the opportunity to travel. If you want to avoid the crowds, fly, but it should get a lot less busy towards the end of the week.
                        </p>
                        <p class="content__text">The Harbin International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival is an annual event officially taking place for a month starting on January 5th each year. It is held in the city of Harbin in the Heilongjiang province. It is one of the world's largest ice and snow festivals, along with Canada's Quebec City Winter Carnival, Japan's Sapporo Snow Festival and Norway's Ski Festival.
                        </p>
                        <p class="content__text">Other events and festivals include:
                        </p>
                        <p class="content__text">Lantern Festival - At the end of February marking the completion of spring festivities, China holds the Lantern Festival. Aptly named for the incredible lantern displays throughout the country’s largest cities, towns, parks and community, the Lantern Festival has existed since China’s ancient dynasties ruled the land. Afterwards, most domestic travellers head back from their holidays to begin a new working year, so transportation is often jam-packed.
                        Pure and Bright Festival (Qingming) - Qingming, otherwise known as Pure and Bright Festival, usually held in April, celebrates the coming of spring’s most beautiful period. Visitors and locals head to parks and gardens to enjoy music, dance and performances in the main cities of China. However, visiting cemeteries is usually the first thing the Chinese citizens do and many locals devote part of the day to tending to graves and honoring ancestors who have passed.
                        Shanghai Formula 1 Grand Prix - Even though this hasn’t been part of the annual calendar as long as some of the more ancient festivals, the Shanghai Formula 1 Grand Prix is a grand spectacle filled with music, food, celebrations, and of course, car racing. Held in Shanghai every April, the city represents China’s leg of this world touring event. Most of the event is held at the Shanghai International Circuit, although there are pre-race parties found throughout the city.
                        Cheng Chau Festival - Lasting for seven days in May, visitors flock to the small island of Cheng Chau every year for an event called the Festival of Bun Hills. Sitting off the southern coast of China, there is an interesting array of activities that include colorful parades, costumes, performances and traditional cuisine.
                        Dragon Boat Festival - The Dragon Boat Festival, or Duanwu Festival, is one of China’s most thrilling events. It is held on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, which usually falls somewhere in June. Dragon boat racing is common in China’s metropolises and on this day a special celebratory cuisine is prepared and eaten, such as realgar wine and zongzi.
                        Mid-Autumn Festival - Sometimes referred to as the Moon Festival, China’s famous Mid-Autumn Festival is usually held in September or October. It follows the lunar calendar, so it changes every year when using modern calendars to set a date. Fire dragon dances, making and eating moon cakes, lighting lanterns, city parades, and even match-making are common activities during this time. Beijing usually experiences heavy crowds and offers plenty of exciting additives to the event.
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="content__title">Weather</h4>
                    <p class="content__text">
                        The weather in China is very extreme. The summers are hot unless you are in the mountains and the winters are very cold, except for a small subtropical portion in the south. Beijing is cold and dry with sporadic snowstorms. Bring a hat, gloves, a scarf and at least 3 to 4 layers of clothing when you are visiting the north of the country in winter.
                    </p>
                        <p class="content__text">The best times to visit the entire country are spring (April to June) and autumn (late September to November), when temperatures in most parts of the country are somewhere between 15 °C and 25 °C, though nights can be chilly, particularly up north and in the mountains.
                        </p>
                        <p class="content__text">The north and northeast of the country are dry with occasional snowstorms in winter. Harbin is famous for its ice sculpture festival in late winter. Temperatures can drop below -40 °C at night during this time.
                        </p>
                        <p class="content__text">In summer, it is usually dry and warm or even hot in some places. This especially applies to the northwest, with Turpan being the oven of China, recording temperatures near 50 °C during some years.
                        </p>
                        <p class="content__text">The central parts of China are a bit less extreme, but note that in summer a combination of high temperatures (up to 40 °C) and high humidity can make things more unbearable than the hot and dry weather further north. Winters here are usually less cold, but freezing temperatures and snow do occur. Summertime sees more rain in this area as well. This also applies to the mountainous parts in the central west, with Tibet being relatively wet in July and August. Winters here can get almost as cold as in the north.
                        </p>
                        <p class="content__text">The south of China has warm and humid weather year round, but even in Hong Kong it is not uncommon for temperatures to drop below 5 °C in winter. Normally it is more like 20 °C, though. Tropical storms hit the Chinese coast occasionally during the July to September period and the hot and humid weather make this time of year not a good time to visit.</p>
